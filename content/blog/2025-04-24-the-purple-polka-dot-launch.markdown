This post is to let you all know about my wife's little online business and the new launch of the new website.

For years Helen has made little gifts and things from wool felt: brooches, key-rings, and banner and garlands. She started making them when she was first ill and dealing with chronic fatigue syndrome just as a way to do something the didn't drain her ernergy too much, and that she can put down at any point if neede. She started selling some of them online, on sites like ebay and etsy and they sold quite well! 

She now does quite well on a monthly basis selling mostly banners and garlands. With Ben now at Uni and Charis starting at college after summer, we've decided to try make a little bit more of it and see if we can grow and branch out into other product areas together. 

So to support this goal, we've set up our own website. We're just getting started, so new products are appearing regularly as we get setup. In the meantime though, go check it out over at [thepurplepolkadot.co.uk](https://thepurplepolkadot.co.uk/)

Peace out.
