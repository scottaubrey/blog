Hi! Welcome to my new blog. I'm starting a new habit, trying to get into a habit of writing something about my day. Anything.

But I do hope it will be interesting. I hope to share interesting technical challenges in my day to day work at <a href="https://www.capuk.org"> Christians Against Poverty </a>. I will likely share something of my family's journey through Elective Home Education. I'm more than likely to talk about my thoughts, feelings and opinions on leadership, project and people management, and the effective work place leadership.

My thoughts and opinons are my own. I will be as open and honest as I can be.

And I hope that You will enjoy something.

\- Scott
