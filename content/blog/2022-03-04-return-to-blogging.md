Well, that's been a while.

I often do this, have a short spurt of blogging, followed by a long period of not doing. Last time I was blogging, I was off work due to stress and anxiety, and found comfort in doing some technical work that had nothing to do with work to keep my mind active.

This time, I have a new job! I started as a DevOps Engineer at [eLife Science publication](https://elifesciences.org), a scientific research journal. Amongst other positive things, one thing this new role affords me is time to blog as part of my contribution to the community and open source.

So I hope to be reviving this blog with new content one a fairly regular basis. Watch this space.
